As described by Amazon Web Services, “DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increase an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.”

We have seen the value of using the best of Lean and Agile in a DevOps approach, which helps streamline software development while it addresses many of the typical problems faced by teams:

Lofty list of improvements that just stew on the back-burner
Speed-to-market is far too slow
Output quality isn’t meeting customer expectations
Standards aren’t clear and execution patterns and practices are inconsistent
Software development teams are mired in poor communication and their efforts are trapped in silos
Collaboration between business requirements management and engineering teams is weak
Software rework is costing you time and budget
Operational metrics are unpredictable
With these challenges in mind, leveraging the DevOps phases is about much more than creating a system; it is a team-organization structure and a working philosophy for thinking and acting; a new cultural norm. If you view DevOps as creating a modern software factory for your technology teams to deliver extraordinary products to your customers, we hope you will quickly see how this context starts to pull every element together.
